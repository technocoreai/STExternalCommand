About
=====

A Sublime Text 2 plugin for modifying buffers using external command output.

Installation
============

You can install this package by running the following in your `Packages`:

    git clone git://github.com/technocoreai/SublimeExternalCommand.git

Commands
========

Filter Through Command
----------------------

Pipes each non-empty selection through an external command and replaces contents of the selection with its output. If there are no non-empty selections, replaces the whole buffer.

To use, press *Edit* / *Filter Through Command* or bind it to a hotkey:

    { "keys": ["…"], "command": "filter_through_command" }


Insert Command Output
---------------------

For every selection, launches external command and inserts output at the start of the selection.

To use, press *Edit* / *Insert Command Output* or bind it to a hotkey:

    { "keys": ["…"], "command": "insert_command_output" }


Notes
=====

External command will be executed asynchronously, so you can cancel it by pressing the same hotkey or using *Edit* / *Cancel External Command*. It will also be automatically cancelled if you try to modify buffer contents, selections, or close the buffer.

Both commands accept an optional *cmdline* argument, so you can use them to quickly bind specific external commands. For example,
add this to your bindings to quickly add line numbers to selected text:

    { "keys": ["…"], "command": "filter_through_command", "args": { "cmdline": "cat -n" } }
